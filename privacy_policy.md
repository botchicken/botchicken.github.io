# BOT Chicken Privacy Policy
Last Updated: September 2, 2022
This privacy notice for BOT Chicken describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share your information when you use this service.
### What information is collected?
The only information that we store about you is your Discord ID, and Steam ID when you enter it into the bot using the -link command in order to associate your Discord to your Steam account. This can be undone at any time using the -unlink command, which removes this information from our storage.

We do not collect any other information so all message content remains on Discord and only Discord when interacting with our bot.
### What do we use this data for?
Although your Steam ID is already public information, we store it in conjuction with your Discord so that you can view your own CS:GO inventory quickly, as well as view other people's inventories given that they are public.
### Contact
For inquiries please contact therealonestig@gmail.com or stig#6474 on Discord.
